`main.py` can handle numbers into the quinquagintillions. `main_expanded.py` can handle absurdly large numbers, however after centillion it uses a non-standard naming pattern as I don't have a major in googolology. Also the code is a lot more scuffed, so `main.py` is the more concise but less powerful version.
